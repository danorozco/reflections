What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates the repository and starts the tracking of your file commits.  You need it so that any changes you make and commit will begin to be tracked.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It acts as the midpoint and allows you determine which files you will be committing.  It allows you to only included the file you want without having to commit all the files.
